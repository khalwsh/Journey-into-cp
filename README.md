# My Journey into Competitive Programming

## Introduction

Welcome to my journey into the world of Competitive Programming (CP). In this README, I'll share with you how I entered the CP world, my learning journey, and some tips and resources that have helped me along the way.

## Background

**CF Handle:** [Khalwsh](https://codeforces.com/profile/Khalwsh)

I wasn't initially interested in computer science; I was just your typical Egyptian teenager who played a lot of video games. When I joined the Faculty of Engineering, I was unsure which department to choose. I was torn between electronics and communication engineering and computer science. However, after a friend introduced me to CSE and Mostafa Sa3d's courses (the greatest one), I decided to give it a try. It was love at first sight, and I found my passion in computer science.

## Entry into Competitive Programming

After watching a lot of videos from Dr. Mostafa Sa3d's (Mastering 4 Critical Skills using C++), the same friend introduced me to Codeforces and problem-solving sheets like Assuits. It was another love-at-first-sight moment. I became hooked on problem-solving, completing Assuits' newcomers in a week and participating in Codeforces rounds. Later, I joined our university community (ICPC), where I learned more about the CP world and made friends.

## Practice Routine

I'm a dedicated nerd who practices problem-solving every day and night. Here are some of the resources I've found helpful:

1. [Assuits' Newcomers](https://codeforces.com/group/MWSDmqGsZm/contests)
2. [Assuits' Phase 1](https://codeforces.com/group/u3Ii79X3NY/contests)
3. [Assuits' Phase 2](https://vjudge.net/group/junuiorsphase2_22)
4. [Complete Training from Zero](https://codeforces.com/group/isP4JMZTix/contests)
5. [CSES Problem Set](https://cses.fi/problemset/)
6. GeeksforGeeks problems
7. AtCoder contests
8. LeetCode
9. ProgVar.fun

## Learning New Topics

When learning a new topic, I typically explore multiple sources, practice with problem sheets, and solve problems on Codeforces from easy to hard. I also read articles on GeeksforGeeks to deepen my understanding.

## Useful Websites

1. [CP Algorithm](https://cp-algorithms.com/)
2. [HackerEarth](https://www.hackerearth.com/)

## Tips

Here are some tips that have helped me along the way:

1. Watch Dr. Mostafa Sa3d's courses.
2. Register for every contest round.
3. Solve a lot of problems.
4. Challenge yourself by solving problems outside your comfort zone.

Happy coding!
