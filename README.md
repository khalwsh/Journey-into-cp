//sorry for any mistakes in spilling
i want to explain all from the beginging 
how i entered the cse department?
in fact i wasn't even interested in computer science that much i was typically egyptian teenager that plays alot of video games.
when i joined the faculty of engineering i was so hesistate in which department i want to procced in i was confused about electronics and communication engineering and computer sicence but thanks god after a friend of mine told me about cse and mostafa sa3d courses(the greatest one) i told myself why not let's try then it was a love from first sight.
this briefly how i joined the cse department.
how i entered the cp world?
after i watched alot of videos from course dr:mostafa sa3d (mastering 4 critical skills using c++)
the same friend introduce me to codeforces and problem solving sheets assuits....
you guessed it! it was a love from first sight.
i became a nerd who do problem solving daily and night i managed to finish assuits's newcomers in a week and begin to participate in codeforces rounds (at this point i finished half of the course so as a newcomer i was solid)
then the same friend of mine( which i owe alot ) introduce me to our university community (ICPC) then i begin to understand how this world like and love it more and more i was very happy to see these smart people and work with become their friend it mean to me alot.
how i usually pratice?
really i am a nerd who pratice every day from every sheet he find from every website every thing every contest but the things which improved me 
1)sheet's assuit 
newcomers https://codeforces.com/group/MWSDmqGsZm/contests
ph1  https://codeforces.com/group/u3Ii79X3NY/contests
ph2 https://vjudge.net/group/junuiorsphase2_22
2)complete training from zero https://codeforces.com/group/isP4JMZTix/contests
but it's not easy 
3)cse problem set (i solve randomly) https://cses.fi/problemset/
4)i found geeks for geeks problems is easy but nice to learn from it
5)participate in every round (if possible) this is very useful
6)atcoder contests 
7)leetcode but it's easy 
8)progvar.fun but it is very hard:)
what i do when learning a new topic?
i usually learn it from multiple source and pratice from the sheets above or set a tag in cf problem set a start solve from easy to hard.
i also read article about it on gfg
useful website to learn from?
1)cp algorithm
2)hacker earth
tips:
1) should see dr:mostafa sa3d courses (you can take his course for now for free but you have to pay it back when you managed by sending him at gmail)
2)register in every round 
3)solve alot of problem
4)solve outside your comfortable zone
